        "\n",
        "Also known as Weak AI, is a level of AI that involves robots that can only do a limited set of activities. At this phase, the machine has no ability to reason and just conducts a series of pre-defined operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cortona, Siri, Alexa, self-driving cars, Alpha-Go, Sophia the humanoid, and others are examples of weak AI.\n",

        "2. General AI or Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence (ANI)\n",
        "\n",
        "AGI, also known as Strong AI, is the step in the development of Artificial Intelligence when robots will be able to reason and make decisions in the same way that humans do. No such ai exist yet.\n",

        "3. Super AI or Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)\n",

        "1. Reinforcement learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Through several rounds of trial and error, these models evolve to make better predictions. Computers are taught to play games like Chess, Go, and DOTA2 using this technique.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs)\n",
        "\n",
        "Researchers reasoned that using past data to predict the next item in a sequence, particularly in language, would be beneficial, therefore they devised a model based on the Long Short Term Memory. The LSTM labels more current information as more significant and those from the past as less essential when predicting the following parts in a sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks (E-GAN)\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the E-GAN has memory, it evolves with each evolution. The model generates a developing entity. Because statistics is a math of chance, not a math of exactitude, growing entities do not always pursue the same route. The model may identify a better path, a path of least resistance, as a result of the changes. The model’s following generation mutates and evolves in the direction of its ancestor’s incorrect route.\n",

        "4. **T**heory of Mind\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "5. **S**elf-Aware AI\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the AI’s final step. Its current presence is simply a rumor, and it can only be found in science fiction films. These AI systems are capable of comprehending and eliciting human feelings, as well as possessing their own emotional states. This form of AI will take decades, if not generations, to develop."
